REmake implements a high-level language for building regular expressions. 
If regular expressions are machine code, the language is assembler. 
You still deal with the low-level regex model, but you do it using more human-friendly terms.

The purpose of the language is to make it easier to write regular expressions for most *scenarios*,
as opposed to writing most regular expressions. In other words, there are some regular expressions that
you can generate using this language, but you can generate most of the regular expressions that you
probably care about using a much more readable and transparent language.
